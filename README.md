# Lab0_CS5005_23SP

IntelliJ is an integrated (program) development environment used by many professional Java programmers (as well as programmers using other programming languages). It is an Open Source product, which means anyone can use it freely and anyone can contribute to its development.

The environment provides an editor, allows you to organize your work into several files that together comprise a project.

There are several step in getting started:

Learn to organize your IntelliJ projects.

Learn to manage your files and save your work.

Learn how to edit your Java programs and run them, using the JUnit testing framework.

This lab is NOT graded. The goal is to get your development environment installed, and to ensure you are familiar with the Gradescope Server.

Begin by going to the JetBrains website and downloading IntelliJ IDEA (the Java IDE we will be using for this course). Here is the link: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/Links to an external site.

The Community Edition of IntelliJ is suitable for this course. As a Northeastern student, you are also eligible to obtain the Ultimate Edition at no-charge. There is a registration and validation process managed by JetBrains on their website if you wish to obtain and use the Ultimate Edition.

After downloading and installing IntelliJ on your computer (follow the instructions from JetBrains pertinent to your type of computer) do the following:

If you have not watched the Lesson 1 video in this module yet, go back and watch that. The Lesson 1 video will give you an overview of how to configure IntelliJ for this course (Be sure you install the intellij-java-google-style.xml style file)
Create a new project called Lab0
Add Person.java and Book.java to your project src directory. Edit the Person and Book class comments to include your name at the top comment block
Add PersonTest.java to your test directory 
Zip your src directory AND your test directory together into a single zip file/compression archive OR push your directories to your GitHub repository if you have one. Note that Gradescope expands directory structures if you use drag-n-drop for uploading files so you MUST zip your solutions if you use the upload approach.
